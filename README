This is a Java Game that was made for the 2005 Users
Conference for CRSoftware LLC. It was something made
in my own spare time so it is owned by me and the 
corporate logos I have permission to use. Feel free
to look and poke around, if the code is used you will not
be able to use the trade marked logos - I may remove
them if I get time.

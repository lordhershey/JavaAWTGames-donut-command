<table width="80%" align="center"><tr><td><p>Welcome to Donut Command! Based off of the popular 80's game Missile Command. 
Donuts rain down from the sky and they are aiming for your collectors! 
Thrills, Chills, and minutes of Fun! 
The concept is simple enough, shoot the donuts so they do not hit collectors, if a collector is hit by a donut he will explode. 
Sometimes you will be targeted by the annoying donut box; which makes a high pitched chirping sound;
 that has a limited ability to dodge some fire, which makes it harder to hit.<br>
There is a speed control for the game, 1 is the slowest setting, and 0 is the fastest; 
numbers 2-9 are steps in between; the default is 6.You can also use the +/- keys to tweak the speed.<br>
When all of the collectors are destroyed the game is over. <br>
You will earn bonus collectors when your score reaches a certain threshold. 
So at the end of a level you may have lost all of your men, but one will appear and you'll advance to the next level.<br>
Ammunition - You receive 2 stock piles of ammunition and receive and extra stock of ammo for every 2 active collectors. 
Each pile of ammunition has 28 bullets, it would be wise to not waste it.
